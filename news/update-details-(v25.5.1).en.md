### 1. New Friends, Trusted Allies — A Host of Brand‑New Plants Arrived:

- **Collaboration Plants:**
  - <u>Astrofruit</u>: Astrofruits shoot five seeking stars that, upon impact, continue to pursue and attack zombies.
  - <u>Doominator‑shroom</u>: Doominator-shrooms continuously shoot fumes that damage and slightly slow all zombies in an area.
  - <u>Helios Cabbage</u>: Helios Cabbages hurl cabbages that are filled with sun at the enemy, dropping sun when hitting zombies.
  - <u>Tubiflora</u>: Tubifloras fire penetrating thorns in all directions when zombies step into the 3x3 area centered on them.
  - <u>Chrysanthe Autumn</u>: Chrysanthe Autumns provide a temporary boost to all plants from other universes on the lawn.
- **New Plant:**
  - <u>Solar Flare</u>: Solar Flare can collect sunlight from the field and discharge sun in a fan-shaped area ahead, dealing explosive damage and leaving a brief of remaining sun—which can be gathered if zombies are defeated within a short period of time.
- **Other Plants:**
  - <u>Doom-shroom</u>: Doom-shroom explodes when destroyed. Depending on the growth stage, Doom-shroom explosion radius will increase and it may even spawn additional Doom-shrooms.
  - <u>Taraxacum</u>: Taraxacums can shoot out a large number of dandelion seeds, sweeping and damaging a 3x3 area around them.
  - <u>Escape Root</u>: Escape Roots explode on contact, and can be swapped with other plants that are in danger.
  - <u>Blast Spinner</u>: Lobs immobilizing, sticky webs at zombies on adjacent lanes. Affected zombies may be turned into cocoons that will explode and deal damage to all surrounding zombies.
